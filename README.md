# Natural-Language-Understanding-for-Multiple-Languages

An NLU Pipeline for Multiple Languages incorporated by a Task-Oriented
Dialogue system that uses user utterance data in the domain of selecting a restaurant for
a meal at some given time, location and date was developed using RASA, a NLU Pipeline
Framework. The system is tasked with classifying intents and recognizing entities to determine
adequate responses in the context of a restaurant information system aiming at a clientele
situated in Bochum, Germany looking for a suitable restaurant. The German Bochumer
Restaurant Information System Dataset was translated to English and annotated to evaluate the
performance of several different Machine Learning approaches using the English Corpus and
the German Corpus as well as both Languages using four different metrics.
